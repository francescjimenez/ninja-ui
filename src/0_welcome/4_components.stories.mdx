## Components

- Designed pieces of UI

It is where we spend most of our time stylizing. We also like to classify own components using Brad Frost’s Atomic Design to be broken down into fundamental building blocks. `Button,` and `Input` atoms bond together to form a `Search` molecule. Pair that `Search` molecule with a `NavBar` molecule and we got ourselves a `Header` organism. Keep this organism thing up and we got a view.

The further classification helps the team and we to take time to think more critically about the design of our components and ask: “How does this fit into the larger design system? Can this feature be broken down further into reusable atomic parts?”
