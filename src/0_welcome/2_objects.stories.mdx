## Objects (Structure)

- OOCSS.
- Design patterns
- Layout
- No cosmetics
- Agnostically named (e.g. list, block, media).

We’ve come to believe structural styling and cosmetic styling are two different beasts. You do structural styling long enough and you’ll notice that they tend to fall into common patterns. You can read the case study for more details (it’s short), but the basic idea is that you can extract the styling for rendering an image to the left of an undefined length of content to be reused.
