# Ninja UI Design System

## Goals

1. Promote consistency across the brand and applications, allowing us to create a unified experience across all touch points.
2. Improve the efficiency of development by ensuring we’re speaking the same language. It allows our conversations to be shaped less around low-level design, and more around what really matters.

## For developers

### Implementation details

- ITCSS: Organization / Architecture
- BEM: css naming
- React: Encapsulate reusable styles via components
- Tooling: webpack, babel, scss

### Customized “Inverted Triangle”

- Settings - Variables (JS& CSS)
- Generic - Resets, main css, mixins, css functions...
- Elements - Bare elements (styled components)
- Objects - Structure components: column, row, container...
- Components - UI: react (JS & CSS) /Atom organization
- Helpers - Utilities in JS

## Usage
#### Install library
```bash
npm install --save ninja-ui
```

#### Theme Provider
Make sure to wrap your app in ThemeProvider to get the default theme:
```javascript
import { ThemeProvider, ThemeBase } from 'ninja-ui';

const App = () => <ThemeProvider theme={ThemeBase}>Hey there👋</ThemeProvider>;
```

#### Importing components from Ninja UI
All components can be imported directly:

```javascript
import { Button } from "ninja-ui";

export default () => (
  <div>
    <Button variant="green" onClick={() => {}}>
      Hello Button
    </Button>
  </div>
);
```
