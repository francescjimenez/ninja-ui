## Elements

- HTML Elements
- H1-H6, basic links, lists, etc
- More opinionated than `generic`
- Last layer we see type selectors (e.g. a {}, blockquote {})

The difference between `elements` and `generic` for us is that `elements` styling is more stylistically opinionated. While we would generally carry `generic` styling over from project to project, we would refrain from doing that with most `elements`styling.
