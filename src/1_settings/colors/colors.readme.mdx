Any design system needs a color pallette in order to make the whole UI more consistent and familiar. Having a concise color pallette helps designers and developers make decisions down the line and have confidence on it. having a good variety of colors does not mean we need to use it all, but give us the right range to select from.

## Anatomy

All colors have a base color and then a variation of its lightness that creates the other siblings. the shape of the color on our theme is this:

```javascript


import colors from './colors';


const theme = {
  //...
  colors: {
    red: [
      "hsl(360, 60%, 99%)",
      "hsl(8, 64%, 88%)",
      "hsl(8, 72%, 62%)",
      "hsl(8, 80%, 64%)",
      "hsl(8, 88%, 56%)",
      "hsl(8, 80%, 40%)",
      "hsl(8, 72%, 32%)",
      "hsl(8, 64%, 24%)",
      "hsl(8, 56%, 16%)"
    ]
    // ... more colors
  }
  //...
};
```

As you can see here, the name of the color is the actual name itself, and then all the lightness variations are included in a array
